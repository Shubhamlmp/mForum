# mForum
The heart of mForum is questions â€” questions that affect the world, questions that explain recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. mForum is a place where you can ask questions that matter to you and get answers from people who have been there and done that. mForum is where scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, mechanics, and homemakers take refuge from misinformation and incendiary arguments to share what they know.
